********************* Line Graph ***********************

Useful when you want to see how a measure changes over a period of time.
Ex: How Sales or Profit changes over different order months.
Refer 14. Line Graph.
Under "Data Series" you can choose which series you want to style - sales or profit.
Choose dashed line, smooth line etc, color, markers etc.
Under X-axis and Y-axis, you can choose to have data labels or not.
You can choose to have Legend or not - useful when there are multiple measures we are trying to track.
You can add Reference lines - a constant or calculated (avg sales, avg profit etc) - and choose to have labels or not for the Reference lines.

******************** Area Chart and Stacked Area Chart *****************************

Very similar to Line Chart - Useful when you want to see how a measure changes over a period of time.
The area under the line is colored for a more graphic picture.
Refer 15. Area Chart and 16. Stacked Area Chart.
We have used an extra dimension (region) in 15 and 16 compared to 14 where we had an extra measure (profit).
This is to show how Stacked Area Chart overcomes the issue of overlapping areas in Area Chart. 
I was not able to add the extra dimension when the extra mesaure was also there.

So, Summarizing, when we have more than 1 measure to compare over a period of time, Line Chart might be good.
When we have to compare 1 measure over a period of time and another dimension (like region, product category etc), Area Chart or Stacked Area Chart might be a better visualization.


******************** Column and Bar Graphs ***************************

Useful when you want to compare sales / profits of different products / product categories. 
Not suitable for trend over a period of time.
Ability to drill down.
Again, you can add other dimensions and use Stacked Bar Graph etc like we did in Area/Stacked area graph.
Vertical Stacked Bar chart, Vertical Stacked 100% Bar chart, Horizontal Bar Char Chart, Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart, Horizontal Stacked 100% Bar chart are different variations available.
Refer 17. Column and Bar graphs.


Refer 18. Recap - bar chart, line chart, filtering and interactions/cross-filtering for a quick recap of different types of visualization and interactions.


********************** Pie chart and Donut chart *********************

Useful when you want to represent a measure by % of a whole ex: 40% of sales is in NA, 35% of sales is in Eurpoe, 25% in Asia etc.
Refer 19. Pie chart and Donut chart
From Data Labels section of the Format Visual you can show percent, value, percent and value, label outside, label inside, no label etc.


********************** Other types of charts *****************************

Refer 20. Other charts

gauge chart - 2 measures - one as a percentage of the other - profit vs sales 

histogram - distribution of 1 measure (sales in this case)

tree map - the size of the rectangles represent the volume of measure (sales in this case)

scatter plot - correlation between 2 measures (cost of sales vs sales)
