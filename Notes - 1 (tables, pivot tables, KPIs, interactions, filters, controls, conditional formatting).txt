Amazon QuickSight uses SPICE, a super-fast calculation engine, to deliver blazing fast performance on your datasets.

****** VISUALIZATION TYPE 1 - TABLE ********
When you login to QuickSight -> Datasets, new dataset, upload a file, Data.xlsx - the tabs within the xlsx will be shown. You can choose to edit/preview the data and then Save/Publish.
Now go to Analyses -> New analysis -> choose the above dataset and click on Use in Analysis.
Change the Visualization from Autograph to "Table". 
So "Table" is the first type of visualization we are seeing in Amazon QuickSight.
Drag the dimensions and measures, change the formatting of numbers if needed, replace/remove dimensions if needed etc.
You can change the sort order using the 3 ... against each field in the fields section or by clicking on the table.
Click on the table -> format visual -> change the title etc.
Add background to headers, change border format, enable totals, add visuals like databars etc.
Refer 1. Sales Report

You can have multiple tables in a single analysis.
Refer 2. Multi-table analysis.

Mutiple types of aggregation - sum, min, max, count, count distinct, ave, median are possible.
Click on the measure in the table to change the default "sum" aggregation type.
Refer 3. Different types of aggregation and 4. Different types of aggregation
You can click on the table -> Format Visual at the top right corner and change Value column names.
See that Order ID and Product Name are dragged into the table as a measure - they become count(order id) and count(product name) by default.
They will be equal but you need to change the count(product name) to count(distinct product name).
When you try to drag a column into a table, you will be shown a blue color + and a green color + -> Choose green color + to drag the field as a measure and blue color + to drag the field as a dimension.

*********** CROSS-FILTERING, INTERACTIONS between tables in an analysis ***********
In an analysis that has multiple tables - you can enable cross-filtering. When you click on an item in 1 table, only related items in the other tables will be shown.
Click on the table -> Properties -> Interactions -> Add action and the target visuals/tables can be all or selective tables. Refer 5. Interactions
The "Filter scope" -> "All fields" means clicking on any of the fields in the source table should result in filtering.
Note that, Cross-filtering, interactions are applicable across different types of visuals in an analyis and not only across tables.
Refer 10. KPIs Tables PivotTables and CrossFiltering.

In an analyis, you can pull in a Date field and then choose to group by Month or Quarter or Year of the date field.
Refer 6. Working with Dates

*********** CONDITIONAL FORMATTING **************
You can choose to highlight certain values in your table using Conditional Formatting.
There are 3 types - Background color, Text Color, Icon based. Background color can be solid or gradient formatting.
You basically select column and the colors/gradient set for different values / ranges. For Icon based, you can choose an Icon set. 
Refer 7. Conditional Formatting. 

*********** VISUALIZATION TYPE 2 - PIVOT TABLE ****************
Pivot table is used instead of normal table when we need table calculations like Percent of total, difference, Percent difference, Running total, Rank, Percentile etc.
Remember to change "Calculate as" to "Table down", "Table across down" etc.
In the "Pivot options" of the Format Visual, you can choose to display in hierarchy format or tabular format, show or hide subtotals etc.
Can be used for more than 1 dimension also, like in a normal table.

*********** PIVOT TABLES and PERCENTAGE CALCULATIONS ****************
With Pivot Tables, you can show each value as a percentage of total. Click on the 3 ellipses near the measure -> Add table calculation -> Percent of total.
Then Calculate as Table across, Table down, Table across down etc as per requirement.
Refer 9. Pivot table with percentages.
Note that this is not possible in a normal table.


*********** VISUALIZATION TYPE 3 - KPI ****************
You can use this KPI visualization to highlight single numbers/measures like total profit etc or use it with different dimensions.
The visual will by itself highlight what is the key statistic.
For ex, in 10. KPIs Tables PivotTables and CrossFiltering -> Profit KPI by region, the visual by itself has decided to compare NAM vs Asia and we dont have control to change it to Europe.

10. KPIs Tables PivotTables and CrossFiltering - is a good summary of what we have learned thus far - Tables, Pivot Tables, KPIs, Percentage of Totals, Cross-Filtering/Interactions between visuals in an analysis.

11. Pivot Table - different types of calculations - shows calculations other than Percent of Total - Running Total, % difference, Rank etc.
Also, interactions-cross filtering. We have a table with year(order_date) and pivot table with month(order_date), profit, running profit, % difference, rank etc.
Note, for table calculations - you need to adjust the "calculate as" as Table down, Table down across etc.
Better to sort by month here and not by Rank, because that visual makes more sense.

************** FILTERS *****************

Filters are possible on text fields, numeric fields and date fields.
Refer 12. Filters
Numeric filters can be >, >=, <, <=, =, between, != etc
Text filters can be a filter list, custom filter list (include, exclude), custom filter (contains, starts with, does not contain etc), top & bottom filter.
The "Total Sales for bottom 10 countries" includes the top & bottom filter -> bottom 10 countries by sales.
Date filters can be date-time range, relative dates (last 3 quarters, previous month etc), top & bottom (top 5 months, bottom 3 days etc).

************** CONTROLS *****************

Controls are very much like Filters.
First create the Filters like above.
Then add them to the sheet and pin to the top of the analysis.
You have some extra "Control" options like Sliders for numeric filters, dropdown / dropdown multiselect etc for text filters.
Also, from the Filters section, you can make teh filter applicable for one or all or specifiv visuals within the analysis.
Refer 13. Controls.
