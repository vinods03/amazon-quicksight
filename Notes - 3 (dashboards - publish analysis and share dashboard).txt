Refer the analysis 21. Comprehensive Sales Report.
This has KPIs, Line Chart, Bar Chart, Pie/Donut Chart, Interactions etc.

How was the standalone Region filter created ?
Click on any one visual, add filter, then add to sheet -> it becomes standalone. Then pin to top, if needed.

Now you can choose to "Publish" this analysis as a "dashboard" -> a read-only report of the analysis.
Once published as a dashboard, go to "Dashboards" tab, open the dashboard and "share" from top-right corner.
Here you can enable access for everyone in this account or invite specific users/groups.
If you enable access for everyone in this account, you can also enable "Discoverable in QuickSight" to make this dashboard visible in QuickSight homepage for all users in this account.

Come outside the dashboard, top-right corner, Manage QuickSight.
Here you can add IAM users who are authors (lakeformation_admin) and IAM users who are readers (lakeformation_user1, lakeformation_user2).
So only these users will have access to the dashboard shared above because of "Enable access for only people Discoverable in QuickSight".
Authors will be able create analyses as well and they will see all options in the left-corner. They can see the dashboard created above as well.
Readers will only be able to see dashboards.
