Go to Datasets (Refer Worksheet).
Add Dataset -> Upload file -> Worksheet.csv. Then add another dataset -> upload file -> Master.csv. Set the join condition (columns / type of join).
Change the table aliases as needed.
Exclude unnecessary columns.
Change data types if needed -> When you change String to Date, if you see data validation warnings, Edit data format and set format for the rows validation failed.
Note that you can apply filter on the dataset itself, instead of applying filter on analysis.

Now, you are ready to use the joined dataset in your analyses.
